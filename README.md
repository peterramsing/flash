## This is a starting point to building a productivity tool for myself

This simply adds and removes hosts file edits to disable sites that I know I can get distracted on. Running this script disables them and allows me to enter "Flash Mode" where I can focus and not get distracted by NASA documentaries on YouTube.

To run: `$ sudo ./flash.sh`

NOTE: This is not tested outside my local environment and requires root access. Use at your own risk.
